# PHP GraphQL Client Generator

This is work in progress library for taking a GraphQL schema and generating a client for it in PHP. The purpose of this is to allow services to communicate between themselves using GraphQL.

## Goals

* Quickly build type-safe clients for building requests to GraphQL servers
* Assist in parsing results
    * Create constants based on schema
